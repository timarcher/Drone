Before building and flying your drone, there are some important preparatory steps to perform. We assume you are flying for recreatrional purposes only within the United States. Other purposes and geopgraphic locations will have their own requirements that you must familiarize yourself with.


1. [Take the Recreational UAS Safety Test](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_flyers/knowledge_test_updates) - This is for recreational flyers only. I used the one from UAV coach on that page and it took about half an hour. If you will be flying for commercial purposes, then you will need to get an FAA Part 107 License. Print your certificate and put it in a binder to keep with you while flying.
1. [Register your drone with the FAA](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/register_drone) - All drones over 250 grams must be registered. This will cost $5. Print your certificate and put it in a binder to keep with you while flying.
1. [Setup the B4UFLY App](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/b4ufly) - FAAâ€™s B4UFLY service shows where recreational flyers can and cannot fly. B4UFLY is no longer in service, and will take you to a list of replacements depending on the platform you will run it on. I installed AutoPylot for Drones on my Android phone.
1. [Get an app to show nearby RemoteId enabled Drones](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.dronetag.dronescanner&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1) - I use Drone Scanner on my Android phone. Others exist as well, find your favorite to use.
