This page contains details on the setup of the Here Flow sensor. The Here Flow optical flow sensor is a lightweight optical flow sensor including a short range lidar which uses the CAN protocol to communicate with the autopilot. This can be used to improve horizontal position control especially in GPS denied environments.
