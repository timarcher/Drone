This page contains details on the installation of a Raspberry Pi 5 companion computer and the setup of a BotBlox SwitchBlox Ethernet switch to create a network onboard the drone.

# Notes
- 192.168.43.1 is HereLink controller IP address when you connect to it through it's WiFi access point mode from a ground control station (i.e., a laptop or computer).
- There is no dhcp provided by the HereLink Air Units. You need to manual set an ip address inside the range eg 192.168.144.0, subnet mask 255.255.255.0. For example, use 192.168.144.50. This will put you within the ip range of the airunit and gcs unit, so they are accessible from the airunit ethernet port.
  - The Airunit and Controller occupy the addresses 192.168.144.10 and 192.168.144.11, so you cannot use these IP addresses for other devices on the network within the drone.
  - HereLink Air Unit is at IP address 192.168.144.10
  - HereLink Controlleris at IP address 192.168.144.11
- You can get rtsp video from 192.168.43.1, 192.168.144.10, or 192.168.144.11
- You can get mavlink from 192.168.43.1, 192.168.144.10, or 192.168.144.11 port 14552
- To be able to route traffic between the Drone Network and the Ground Control Station HereLink WiFi AP:
  - GCS/Laptop needs a static route to 192.168.144.0/24 via 192.168.43.1
    - To do this, assuming your GCS is a Windows PC, open a command prompt as administrator and run `route add 192.168.144.0 mask 255.255.255.0 192.168.43.1`
    - To make the route persistent across reboots, run it with the -p flag: `route -p add 192.168.144.0 mask 255.255.255.0 192.168.43.1`
  - Companion computer needs a static route for 192.168.43.0/24 via 192.168.144.11
    - To do this temporarily, run the command: `sudo ip route add 192.168.43.0/24 via 192.168.144.11`
    - To do it permanently, simply leave in the routes section in the static IP configuration as shown below.
- URL for the RTSP video stream is: rtsp://192.168.43.1:8554/fpv_stream or rtsp://192.168.144.11:8554/fpv_stream

# Setting An IP Address on the Raspberry Pi
The following commands will give your Raspberry Pi a static IP address that will allow it to communicate with the HereLink Air Unit, Controller, and the Ground Control Station (if connected through the WiFi AP on the HereLink controller). 

- Open the Netplan configuration file for editing: `sudo vi /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml`
- Edit the configuration file to set the static IP address. The file should look something like this
```
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      addresses:
        - 192.168.144.55/24
      dhcp4: no
      routes:
        - to: 192.168.43.0/24
          via: 192.168.144.11
```
- After saving the file, apply the Netplan configuration with the following command: `sudo netplan apply`
- Verify the configuration. You can check the IP address assignment by using the ip command: `ip addr show eth0`

# Python, Pymavlink, and DroneKit
You may wish to interact with your drone from your companion computer using Python. This section shows the basics of how to communicate with the ArduPilot flight controller.

- [Pymavlink](https://github.com/ArduPilot/pymavlink) is a Python library for generating and parsing MAVLink messages. MAVLink (Micro Air Vehicle Link) is a communication protocol used primarily in drone applications for telemetry and command/control communication.
- [Dronekit](https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-python) is a higher-level Python library that simplifies interaction with drones using the MAVLink protocol. It abstracts many of the complexities of MAVLink, providing a more user-friendly API for controlling drones, accessing telemetry data, and performing autonomous flight operations. Dronekit is best used for rapid development and prototyping of drone applications. It is suitable for users who need to interact with and control drones without delving into the details of MAVLink message handling. It also appears the Dronekit may not be well maintained anymore, but is suitable for basic prototyping. I was unable to get dronekit working correctly in my setup but I am linking to it here just in case it is useful.


1. Install dependencies: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-full python3-pip python-is-python3`
1. Create a python virtual environment: `python3 -m venv drone01`
1. Activate virtual environment: `source drone01/bin/activate`
1. Install python libraries into the virtual environment: `pip3 install pymavlink dronekit`
1. Try a simple dronekit test program. Create a file named `drone_test1.py` and add this to it:
```python3
import time
from pymavlink import mavutil

drone = mavutil.mavlink_connection("udpout:192.168.144.10:14550")

drone.mav.ping_send(
    int(time.time() * 1e6), # Unix time in microseconds
    0, # Ping number
    0, # Request ping of all systems
    0 # Request ping of all components
)

drone.wait_heartbeat()

print(f"Drone Target System: {drone.target_system}")

while True:
    try:
        print(drone.recv_match().to_dict())
    except:
        pass
    time.sleep(0.1)
```
1. Deactivate the virtual environment: `deactivate`
1. Delete the virtual environment: `rm -rf drone01`
