# Notes
- I replaced the stock 12mm payload carbon fiber tubes that came with the drone with longer 330mm ones from Amazon.
- I bought a longer 6-Pin JST-GH Twisted Pair - MRC0212 - 1000mm length cable from 3DR in order to make the serial connection from the gimbal to the Kore carrier board. Its a 6 pin connector and wire designed for I2C, but I removed 3 wires and swapped TX/RX on one end to make it work for the gimbal.
- The gimbal serial connection gets connected to the Telemetry 2 port on the Kore carrier board. See [this page for the wiring diagram](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-gremsy-pixyu-gimbal.html).
