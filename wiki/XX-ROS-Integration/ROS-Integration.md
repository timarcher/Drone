# Notes
- Make sure you have a Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu 24.04 installed on it first. See the [Onboard-Computer-and-Ethernet](../10-Onboard-Computer-and-Ethernet/Onboard-Computer-and-Ethernet.md) page and associated video if you havent done that yet.

# ROS2 Installation Notes
- Follow the instructions to install ROS2 on your Raspberry Pi by following the guide for [Installing ROS2 on Ubuntu 24.04](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html). I installed the Recommended Desktop Install wehich includes ROS, RViz, demos, tutorials. You need this to run the talker/listener demo in the install instructions.
- Edit ~/.bashrc to add the following line to it so your ROS environment is configured every time you login:
```sh
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
```
- Install MAVROS for ROS 2 to use ROS 2 to read a MAVLink stream:
```sh
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-mavros ros-jazzy-mavros-extras
```
- Install the geopgraphic lib
```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mavlink/mavros/master/mavros/scripts/install_geographiclib_datasets.sh
sudo bash ./install_geographiclib_datasets.sh
```
- Verify the installation:
```sh
ls /usr/share/GeographicLib/geoids/
# You should see the egm96-5.pgm file, among others, in this directory.
```
