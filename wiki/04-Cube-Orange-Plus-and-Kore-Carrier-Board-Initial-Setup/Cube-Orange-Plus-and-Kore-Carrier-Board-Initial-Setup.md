# Notes
- Its important to note that the auxiliary ports of the Kore carrier board map to servo ports starting at 9. So:
  - Kore Carrier Board Auxiliary Port 1 = SERVO9
  - Kore Carrier Board Auxiliary Port 2 = SERVO10
  - Kore Carrier Board Auxiliary Port 3 = SERVO11
  - Kore Carrier Board Auxiliary Port 4 = SERVO12
  - Kore Carrier Board Auxiliary Port 5 = SERVO13
  - Kore Carrier Board Auxiliary Port 6 = SERVO14
- You must supply 5v power to the auxiliary ports if you wish to power devices connected to those ports. I applied a simple 5v supply to auxiliary port 6. Applying power to one auxiliary port will power them all. It is recommended to use a BEC to supply power to these ports if you will be attaching noisy devices such as servos.
