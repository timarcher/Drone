# Notes
- Read the blog post [How to methodically configure and tune any ArduCopter Blog Post](https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/how-to-methodically-configure-and-tune-any-arducopter/110842) several times. It tooks me several reads before it really started to sink in.
- You may be in a hurry to skip steps you understand. Dont. This utility had me exploring areas of the documentation I have never read, and using tools I did not know existed. Think of it as a great structured classroom for learning how to tune your drone.
- Take the time to understand why each parameter is set the way it is.
