# Notes
- Be sure to enable video sharing in the Herelink controller.
- In the Joystick settings, 
  - Change the default channel for the wheel at the top from channel 5 to 16.
  - Check the Wheel Acc setting
  - Reverse the hardwheel wheel as well so when you push it to the right it outputs a higher pulse on sbus out.
