This page contains details on the installation of the electronics into the drone frame.

# YouTube Video
- [Hexacopter Drone Build Project â€“ Part 13 Electronics Installation](https://youtu.be/XXX)

# Notes
- Not many notes for the build, I recommend watching the video. There were lots of things to figure out and play with to get positioning right. Space in the frame ended up being tight.
- The STL and Autodesk Fusion files for the 3d printed antenna mounts are [located here](../../3d-print-files/antenna-l-bracket/).


# Supporting Materials
