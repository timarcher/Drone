This page contains details on the setup of the SSD1306 OLED Display.

The Here 4 GPS is a professional High Precision Dual-band RTK Navigation module. It supports multiple GNSS options such as BeiDou, Galileo, GLONASS, GPS, QZSS.

The Here 4 Base employs RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) technology to offer more precise position estimation compared to standard GNSS systems. Its potential for centimeter-level accuracy greatly enhances flight precision. The Here 4 supports L1 and L5 bands. Utilizing the L5 band delivers improved performance under challenging urban environments. The L5 signals fall within the protected ARNS (aeronautical radio navigation service) frequency band, leading to less RF interference.
