MOT_SPIN_ARM,0.1  # Point at which the motors start to spin expressed as a number from 0 to 1 in the entire output range. Should be lower than MOT_SPIN_MIN.
MOT_SPIN_MAX,0.95  # Point at which the thrust saturates expressed as a number from 0 to 1 in the entire output range
MOT_SPIN_MIN,0.15  # Point at which the thrust starts expressed as a number from 0 to 1 in the entire output range. Should be higher than MOT_SPIN_ARM.
MOT_THST_EXPO,0.65  # Motor thrust curve exponent (0.0 for linear to 1.0 for second order curve)
