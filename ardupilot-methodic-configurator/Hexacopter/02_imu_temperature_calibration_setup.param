BRD_HEAT_TARG,65  # Reasonable for most places on this planet
INS_LOG_BAT_MASK,1  # Calculate IMU calibration for all IMUs, irrespective of their usage in a future step. Saves the trouble of recalibrating an inactive IMU if you later decide to activate it
LOG_BITMASK,524416  # Only for IMU and Raw-IMU
LOG_DISARMED,1  # Gather data for the offline IMU temperature calibration while the FC is disarmed
